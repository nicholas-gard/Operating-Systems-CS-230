Operating Systems

1.	The Gaming Room requested a game called Draw it or Lose It for customers to play together in their computer lounge. They requested that the software render images for players to guess on from a large stock library of images. The players should be able to form teams where the captain is in charge of operating the system.
2.	I believe I did a good job of describing the design for the game based on the UML diagram. Since beginning this program, I have had a hard time understanding UML diagrams. Over the course of my classes, I’ve come to understand them and the concepts they represent well. I think I did a good job mapping out how the software should be written.
3.	The most helpful part for me was certainly the UML diagram. Having a quick reference for classes, their interactions and objects is very useful when coding. 
4.	I would like to revise and expand more on potential operating systems. I have some experience with server management and the operating system is an integral part of a server. I’d like to do more research and dig more into what would be the most efficient one for this specific task. 
5.	I interpreted the need for a fast load time from the fact that the Gaming Room is a business. People expect instant load times, so I know some sort of caching or local server was necessary. This is very important since as a coder you understand how software works much more in depth than a layman. You need to anticipate the clients’ needs and translate that into your code.
6.	I always approach designing software in sections. Making sure one section is complete and tested before moving onto the next. In the future I would like to expand on adding detail to my initial designs. Adding in potential design patterns could help to find more efficient ways to code software.
